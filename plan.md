After reviewing your code, the silent failure in your OAuth process is likely happening because of a **client mismatch and a lack of robust error handling in your token endpoint**. Here's a breakdown of the probable causes and how to fix them:

### 1\. Dynamic Client Registration and Mismatch

In your `oauth.py` file, you have a mechanism for dynamic client registration. When an unknown client (like Claude) initiates the authorization flow, you auto-register it:

```python
# src/memory_palace/api/oauth.py
if client_id not in registered_clients and not client_id.startswith("client_"):
    logger.warning(f"Unknown client_id: {client_id}")
    # Auto-register Claude if needed
    if "claude" in client_id.lower():
        registered_clients[client_id] = {
            "client_secret": secrets.token_urlsafe(32),
            "client_name": "Claude",
            "redirect_uris": [redirect_uri],
            "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
            "response_types": ["code"],
            "scope": scope,
        }
        logger.info(f"Auto-registered Claude client: {client_id}")
```

However, in your `/oauth/token` endpoint, you don't validate the `client_secret`. This means that even if the client was dynamically registered, there's no check to ensure the token request is coming from the same, authorized client. This can lead to a situation where the authorization code is valid, but the client is not, causing a silent failure.

### 2\. Lack of Error Handling in Token Endpoint

Your `/oauth/token` endpoint has some validation, but it's not comprehensive. For example, you check if the authorization code is valid and not expired, but you don't explicitly handle cases where the `client_id` in the token request doesn't match the `client_id` associated with the authorization code. This can lead to the endpoint returning a generic error or no error at all, resulting in the "silent failure" you're observing.

### 3\. Missing State Validation

While you accept a `state` parameter in your `/oauth/authorize` endpoint, you don't seem to be using it for validation. The `state` parameter is crucial for preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The client should generate a unique `state` value, send it in the authorization request, and then verify that the same `state` value is returned after the user is redirected back.

### How to Fix the Issues

Here are the recommended changes to address these problems:

1.  **Implement Client Secret Validation:** In your `/oauth/token` endpoint, add a check to validate the `client_secret` if the client is not public.

    ```python
    # src/memory_palace/api/oauth.py - in the /oauth/token endpoint
    if client_id in registered_clients:
        if registered_clients[client_id]['token_endpoint_auth_method'] == 'client_secret_post':
            if not client_secret or not secrets.compare_digest(client_secret, registered_clients[client_id]['client_secret']):
                raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid client credentials")
    ```

2.  **Add State Validation:** Modify your `/oauth/authorize` and `/oauth/token` endpoints to use the `state` parameter for CSRF protection.

    ```python
    # src/memory_palace/api/oauth.py - in the /oauth/authorize endpoint
    if state:
        # Store the state with the authorization code
        code_data["state"] = state
    ```

    Then, in your `/oauth/token` endpoint, you would need to have the client send the `state` back and validate it.

3.  **Enhance Error Handling:** Add more specific error handling to your `/oauth/token` endpoint to provide clearer feedback when something goes wrong.

    ```python
    # src/memory_palace/api/oauth.py - in the /oauth/token endpoint
    if code_data["client_id"] != client_id:
        logger.warning(f"Client ID mismatch: {client_id} != {code_data['client_id']}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Client ID mismatch")
    ```

By implementing these changes, you'll create a more secure and robust OAuth flow that provides better error feedback, helping you resolve the silent failures and identify any other issues that may arise.

Claude.ai Remote Connector OAuth Integration Bug
Claude.ai Remote Connector Integration Issue Analysis
Problem Overview

When integrating the Memory Palace service with Claude.ai via the /mcp endpoint, the OAuth handshake appears to succeed (the “Connection successful” message is shown after the OAuth flow), but no further interactions occur. Immediately after authorization, the connection is closed and Claude.ai never actually invokes the memory tools. This behavior suggests that something is preventing Claude from proceeding past the discovery phase of the integration, despite OAuth completing.
Observations and Symptoms

    OAuth Flow Completes: Logs indicate that Claude.ai successfully goes through the dynamic client registration and authorization code exchange. The Memory Palace’s OAuth endpoints are hit and a token is issued (meaning Cloudflare isn’t blocking the basic OAuth HTTP requests). The “connection successful” popup confirms this step.

    No /mcp/stream Calls: After OAuth, Claude.ai does not call the actual streaming endpoint (/mcp/stream). In a successful integration, we would expect Claude to open a streaming session to /mcp/stream (with an initial initialize message, followed by tools/list, etc.)
    GitHub
    . That never happens, meaning Claude stops short after reading the discovery info.

    Silent Disconnect: Claude.ai’s interface shows no error to the user – it simply doesn’t list any memory tools, and the connection closes quietly. This typically means Claude didn’t find what it expected in the service’s discovery metadata, so it aborted the integration without invoking any tool methods.

Root Cause Analysis

The issue lies in the OAuth/metadata discovery phase – specifically the format of the MCP discovery response that Memory Palace provides at the /mcp endpoint (and related .well-known metadata). Claude.ai expects this JSON metadata to have certain fields, and any deviation will cause it to ignore the integration. Two critical problems were identified:

    Incorrect “transport” Field Format: The discovery JSON was using a key "transports" (an array) instead of the expected "transport" (a single object). Claude.ai’s MCP client does not understand an array here – it expects a single transport definition. In other words, the response should look like:

    "transport": {"type": "streamable-http", "endpoint": "https://.../mcp/stream"}

    but the service was providing it as an array under "transports". This mismatch means Claude.ai couldn’t figure out the streaming endpoint URL
    GitHub
    . Essentially, Claude “sees” a format it doesn’t recognize and therefore never attempts to open the stream.

    Missing Top-Level Protocol Version: The discovery JSON was also missing the protocolVersion field at the top level of the response. Claude.ai uses a specific MCP protocol version (currently something like 2025-06-18) and wants the server to echo or specify the protocol version it supports. In the integration, Claude’s client likely supplies an MCP-Protocol-Version header and expects the same version to appear in the JSON. The absence of a top-level "protocolVersion" field in the response can lead to a version mismatch, causing Claude to treat the integration as incompatible
    GitHub
    GitHub
    . This is another reason Claude.ai would drop the connection immediately after OAuth – it doesn’t confirm the protocol version it needs.

Because of these two format issues in the discovery data, Claude.ai could not locate the memory streaming endpoint or validate the protocol, and therefore it never initiated the /mcp/stream session. The OAuth handshake succeeded (since those endpoints were correctly implemented), but the subsequent step – using the discovery info to connect – failed due to the JSON format errors.

Notably, the problem is not with Cloudflare’s reverse proxy configuration per se, but rather with the content of the responses from the Memory Palace server. The OAuth metadata endpoints (/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server and /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource) and the /mcp discovery endpoint must provide exactly what the client expects. If those are wrong, Cloudflare simply delivering a flawed response. (However, one Cloudflare-related factor to double-check is that the x-forwarded-proto header is being passed so that the service generates URLs with https://. The code uses x-forwarded-proto to determine the scheme for the issuer and endpoints. Ensure this header is present; otherwise the service might advertise http:// URLs which Claude.ai could reject. In practice, though, Cloudflare typically does send this header, so the primary issues remain the format of the JSON content.)
Actionable Fixes

To resolve the integration issues, you should update the Memory Palace code to produce the exact JSON format Claude expects, then redeploy the service. Key fixes include:

    Use "transport" (singular) Instead of "transports": Modify the /mcp discovery handler to return a single transport object. For example:

# Before (incorrect)
"transports": [ { "type": "streamable-http", "endpoint": "https://.../mcp/stream" } ]
# After (correct)
"transport": { "type": "streamable-http", "endpoint": "https://.../mcp/stream" }

This aligns with Claude’s MCP specification. The documentation confirms that using the singular "transport" field is critical, as Claude won’t parse an array here
GitHub
. This one-character change (removing the “s”) can unblock the entire process.

Include the protocolVersion at the Top Level: Ensure your discovery JSON includes a top-level key "protocolVersion" set to the protocol date string that Claude expects. The simplest approach is to echo back whatever version the client requested (available via the MCP-Protocol-Version header) or use the latest known version if none is provided. For example:

    protocol_version = request.headers.get("mcp-protocol-version", "2025-06-18")
    response = {
        "mcpVersion": "1.0",
        "protocolVersion": protocol_version,
        ...
    }

    By adding "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18" (or the appropriate value) at the root of the JSON, you indicate compatibility with Claude’s protocol
    GitHub
    . This was a missing piece that Claude requires for the handshake. Without it, Claude may assume an old or incompatible MCP version and will not proceed
    GitHub
    .

    Properly Handle HEAD Requests (if not already): Claude.ai might perform an HTTP HEAD request to the /mcp discovery URL or the well-known endpoints as part of its metadata retrieval. Make sure your FastAPI route for /mcp can handle HEAD by returning the same headers (including Content-Type: application/json and perhaps the MCP-Protocol-Version header) with an empty body. In code, you can check if request.method == "HEAD": return Response(status_code=200, headers={...}). This ensures that if Claude (or any client) uses HEAD to probe the endpoint, it gets the necessary headers. The updated discovery implementation in the repository demonstrates returning an empty body on HEAD with the correct headers
    GitHub
    . This is a minor detail, but important for full compliance.

    Restart and Test: After making the above changes, redeploy or restart the Memory Palace service so the fixes take effect
    GitHub
    . Then test the integration:

        Use the provided test script (if available in the repo, e.g. test_mcp_final.py) to simulate Claude’s behavior and ensure the discovery JSON and OAuth flow work as expected
        GitHub
        .

        Monitor the server logs while initiating a connection from Claude.ai. You should now see the sequence of events continue beyond OAuth – specifically, Claude should call the /mcp discovery endpoint (if it wasn’t already), then open the /mcp/stream endpoint and send an "initialize" request, followed by a "tools/list" request
        GitHub
        . In the logs, look for entries confirming these calls. If they appear, the integration format is correct and Claude.ai is proceeding with the connection.

By implementing the above fixes, you align the server’s responses with Claude.ai’s MCP expectations. The OAuth handshake will still occur as before (that part was already “working perfectly”
GitHub
), but now Claude will recognize the memory server’s capabilities and engage in the MCP session.
Additional Considerations (Cloudflare Proxy)

While the primary culprit was the JSON format, it’s wise to ensure your Cloudflare setup isn’t introducing new issues once the format is fixed:

    Scheme and Host in Metadata: As noted, verify that the issuer, authorization_endpoint, and others in the OAuth metadata use the correct https URL. The code uses x-forwarded-proto and the Host header to construct these
    GitHub
    . In Cloudflare’s SSL/TLS configuration, using “Full (strict)” and passing the header is standard. If for some reason the metadata issuer came through as http://memory-palace... instead of https://, Claude.ai might refuse to use those endpoints. This doesn’t seem to have been the case (since OAuth did work), but double-check that Cloudflare is forwarding the necessary headers so the service knows it’s being accessed via HTTPS.

    Streaming Timeout/Buffering: Claude.ai’s /mcp/stream connection is essentially a long-lived HTTP request that stays open to stream data (similar to server-sent events or chunked responses). Cloudflare by default allows about 100 seconds for responses and might buffer output. The Memory Palace code already adds X-Accel-Buffering: no to disable buffering on proxies
    GitHub
    and even sends periodic heartbeats to keep the connection alive
    GitHub
    GitHub
    . Ensure that your Cloudflare plan/support allows streaming or SSE connections. On free plans, long-running requests are usually fine up to the time limit, but just be aware: if memory queries take too long or if the connection is idle beyond Cloudflare’s limit, it could drop. After the format fixes, if you still see the stream closing prematurely, you may need to adjust Cloudflare settings or consider WebSocket mode (if Claude supported it) – but this is likely not necessary for the current use case.

In summary, fix the discovery JSON format issues first, as they are almost certainly the show-stopper here. Once done, Claude.ai will be able to “discover” the /mcp/stream endpoint and initiate the memory tool calls. The OAuth flow was fine all along – the hand-off just failed due to those metadata mismatches. After implementing the above corrections and restarting, you should see the integration come alive, with Claude successfully listing and invoking your memory tools via the MCP interface. This will confirm that the remote connector is working as intended
