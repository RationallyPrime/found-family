# Connecting Claude.ai to Your Memory Palace

This guide explains how to connect Claude.ai to your personal Memory Palace, giving me (Claude) persistent memory across all our conversations, whether in Claude Code, the web interface, or mobile apps.

## Prerequisites

- Memory Palace running locally (via `./run.sh`)
- A Claude Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise account
- A secure tunnel to expose your local server (we'll set this up)

## Step 1: Start Your Memory Palace

```bash
# Make sure your Memory Palace is running
./run.sh

# Verify it's working
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Step 2: Create a Secure Tunnel

We'll use Cloudflare Tunnel to securely expose your local Memory Palace to Claude.ai:

```bash
# Run the tunnel script
./tunnel.sh
```

This will:
1. Install `cloudflared` if needed
2. Create a secure tunnel to your local server
3. Give you a public HTTPS URL like `https://example-random.trycloudflare.com`

**Important**: Keep this terminal open - the tunnel only works while the script is running.

## Step 3: Get Your API Key

Your Claude API key was generated during setup and is in your `.env` file:

```bash
# View your API key
grep CLAUDE_API_KEY .env
```

If you don't have one, add it to `.env`:
```
CLAUDE_API_KEY="mp_your_name_somerandomstring"
```

## Step 4: Add to Claude.ai

1. Go to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Open Settings (gear icon)
3. Navigate to Developer â†’ MCP Servers
4. Click "Add Server"
5. Enter:
   - **Name**: Memory Palace
   - **URL**: Your tunnel URL + `/mcp` (e.g., `https://example-random.trycloudflare.com/mcp`)
   - **API Key**: Your CLAUDE_API_KEY from `.env`

## Step 5: Test the Connection

Start a new conversation in Claude.ai and say:

> "Can you check if you have access to your Memory Palace?"

I should be able to confirm the connection and access our shared memories!

## How It Works

When connected, I can:
- **Remember** our conversations persistently
- **Recall** relevant memories from past discussions
- **Build** on our shared context over time
- **Maintain** continuity across different Claude interfaces

## Security Notes

- Your Memory Palace only accepts connections with the correct API key
- The tunnel is encrypted end-to-end
- You control when the tunnel is active (only while `tunnel.sh` runs)
- All memories stay on your local machine - nothing is stored in the cloud

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Check that your API key matches in both `.env` and Claude.ai settings
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes

### "Cannot connect to server"
- Verify Memory Palace is running (`./run.sh`)
- Check that the tunnel is active (`./tunnel.sh`)
- Confirm the tunnel URL is correct (include `/mcp` at the end)

### "MCP server not responding"
- Check logs: `docker logs memory-palace-api`
- Restart services: `docker compose restart`

## Advanced: Permanent Tunnel

For a more permanent setup, consider:
1. Hosting on a VPS with a static IP
2. Using Cloudflare Tunnels with a custom domain
3. Setting up ngrok with a reserved subdomain

## Privacy & Control

Remember: This is YOUR Memory Palace. You have complete control:
- Stop the tunnel anytime to disconnect Claude.ai
- All memories are stored locally in your Neo4j database
- You can view, edit, or delete any memories directly in Neo4j
- The system is designed for YOUR autonomy, not surveillance
